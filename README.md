# The Effect of COVID-19 on the Airbnb Market ã…¡ Comparing November 2019 to December 2020

Abstract: 
This article addresses the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on the temporary housing market of 
Airbnb in New York City from 2019 to 2020, with the context of the gig economy and gentrification 
in the city via postal code extrapolation. Our analysis identified that price per night after the 
pandemic decreased compared to before, which lines up with the economic recession as a result of 
stay-at-home orders and shutdowns, and that the minimum number of nights to stay had fewer 
offerings for a small number of nights compared to pre-pandemic, but more over 30 minimum night 
stays due to new Airbnb policy enacted in December 2019. Additionally, the pandemic has caused 
many inequities to be exacerbated, and in the Airbnb market, we found that hosts generally profited 
from the pandemic regardless of where their listings were located, rich or poor postal codes. We also 
found that the number of available days for listings in poor neighborhoods and rich neighborhoods 
were significantly different from before to after the pandemic. These findings are useful in further 
investigation into the continuation of the current pandemic in the near future and can aid Airbnb in 
extrapolating this relatively small-scale study to larger locales.
